# React 15 game 

- [Demo Page](https://kvisaz.github.io/neuro-001-react-15-2/)
- [ChatGPT log](log.md) (shortened)

I tried to use ChatGPT to understand how to rule this neural chat to create 15 game in TypeScript React

## Resume
1. ChatGPT 3.5 doesn't follow instructions exactly
2. but can be very useful for creating small project step-by-step
3. CSS rules works from box
4. React syntax is slightly obsolete (use 'import React')
